## 🔄 STAR Reflection Summaries

### 🧭 Career Counselling

**📁 Evidence:** [View Career Development Completion Evidence](./TaskCompleted/CareerDevelopment.png)

**Reflection:**  
At the beginning of the Work Readiness Programme, I realized I didn’t have a clear idea of where I wanted to position myself within the ICT industry. While I had interests in front-end development, I hadn’t yet mapped a structured career path or defined long-term goals.

My task during this module was to reflect deeply on my values, strengths, and professional interests to create a realistic and structured career development plan. This included setting SMART goals that would serve as a roadmap over the next 1–3 years.

I engaged with the online module activities, which included self-assessment questionnaires and vision planning tasks. I identified key drivers like creativity, stability, and purpose. I outlined a three-year vision for myself and broke it down into SMART objectives. For example, one goal was to become proficient in React by the end of this year and complete a Google UX Design certification the following year.

By the end of the module, I had created a formal career development plan that aligned with my aspirations and outlined clear, actionable steps. I now feel more confident in my future direction and have a plan that motivates me to keep learning and improving.

### 🎯 Skills and Interests

**📁 Evidence:** [View Skill and Interest Completion Evidence](./TaskCompleted/SkillandInterest.png)

**Reflection:**  
Before completing this module, I had a general understanding of what I was good at, but I couldn’t clearly articulate how my skills aligned with career opportunities. I needed a structured way to identify and reflect on my strengths and areas for growth.

I was required to explore both my technical and soft skills and map them to ICT roles. This included completing skills assessments and reflecting on how my skills have been applied in both academic and real-life contexts.

I completed the online Skills & Interests module and used the skills audit tool to identify my top competencies—such as front-end development, teamwork, Firebase integration, and documentation. I linked these skills to projects I’ve worked on, like StepUp and the Nanny Service App, where I played a key role in UI development and Firebase database setup.

This activity helped me develop a clear profile of my current capabilities and gave me direction on where to focus my growth. I now have a skills roadmap that supports both my career goals and academic projects, and I feel more confident about showcasing my strengths in interviews or job applications.

### 👤 Personality Assessment

**📁 Evidence:** [View Personal Assessment Completion Evidence](./TaskCompleted/PersonalAssessment.png)

**Reflection:**  
I was curious about how my personality affects my teamwork and learning style, especially in group projects and during job interviews. I wanted to understand myself better to work more effectively with others.

The goal was to complete a personality test and reflect on how the results relate to my professional development and interpersonal relationships in the workplace.

I took the 16Personalities test and discovered that I fall under the INFJ category, often referred to as “The Advocate.” This result made sense, as I often enjoy meaningful work, long-term planning, and supporting others in achieving success. I reflected on how this showed up in my group work—especially in how I take on planning roles, ensure tasks are well organized, and mediate conflicts when they arise.

I gained greater self-awareness and clarity about what roles suit my personality best. I learned that I thrive in structured yet creative environments, and I’m more likely to succeed in positions where empathy and communication are valued alongside technical ability.

### 📄 Create a CV

**📁 Evidence:** [View Create a Cv Completion Evidence](./TaskCompleted/CreateCv.png)
**Reflection:**  
Before this module, I had a basic CV that lacked structure and didn’t effectively communicate my skills or experiences. I needed to create a professional document that could be used to apply for internships and job opportunities.

My task was to build a clear, well-formatted CV that highlights my qualifications, technical abilities, personal achievements, and project experience in a way that stands out to potential employers.

I followed the CV Writing module on Blackboard and used the class template to organize my information. I included sections on education, technical skills (like React, Firebase, Git), projects (like StepUp and the Caretaking App), and contactable references. I revised the CV based on class tutorials and peer feedback and ensured it was free of grammatical errors.

I produced a polished and professional CV that effectively represents me. I’m now confident in using it for internship applications and as a foundation for future job searches. The process also improved my ability to present myself professionally on paper.

### 📤 CV Submission

**📁 Evidence:** [View CV Submission Completion Evidence](./TaskCompleted/CVsubmission.png)

**Reflection:**  
After creating my CV, I had to ensure it was submitted through the proper channels and met the academic and professional standards required for the Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) placement process.

The requirement was to finalize my CV, proofread it thoroughly, and submit it on Blackboard before the deadline. I also needed to make sure it was saved in the correct format and followed the submission instructions exactly.

I reviewed my CV one last time and double-checked all formatting, spelling, and structure. I made sure my name was in the file name and that it was exported as a PDF. After confirming everything was correct, I uploaded the CV to Blackboard and received confirmation of successful submission.

Submitting my CV on time and correctly gave me a sense of accomplishment and preparedness. I now understand how important it is to meet professional standards and pay attention to submission guidelines, both in academic settings and the workplace.
